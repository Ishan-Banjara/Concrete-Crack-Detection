# Concrete-Crack-Detection
This repository contains a CNN model that helps to detect concrete crack.
The dataset was downloaded in zip format from website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection

The archive.zip file is from the above link.
Due to lack of computational resources only 8,000 of the image dataset were used out of 40,000.

The CNN model built for the project was inspired from Siamese Network. Link to paper: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf

The model built can be clearly explained from the picture below:

This project idea was inspired from the github: https://github.com/konskyrt/Concrete-Crack-Detection-Segmentation/tree/main

Here's some output result from my Google Colab

In future, I will explore in crack depth prediction
